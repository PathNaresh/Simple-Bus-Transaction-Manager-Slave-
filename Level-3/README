Let‚Äôs now evolve manager‚Äìslave Verilog model into a Level-3 version ‚Äî closer to a real SoC interconnect (like a simplified AXI-Lite).

This one introduces:
  Multiple slaves
  Address decoding (simple interconnect)
  Backpressure (slave not always ready)
  Independent read/write response timing

‚öôÔ∏è System Overview :

        +------------------+
        |     Manager      |
        |  (Bus Initiator) |
        +------------------+
                 |
                 v
        +------------------+
        |  Simple Bus Arb  |  ‚Üê address decoder / mux
        +------------------+
          |           |
          v           v
   +-----------+   +-----------+
   |  Slave 0  |   |  Slave 1  |
   |  (Mem A)  |   |  (Mem B)  |
   +-----------+   +-----------+

1Ô∏è‚É£ Common Interface :  We‚Äôll use the same interface as before, with valid/ready and response.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Manager (Initiator) : The manager will now issue accesses to two different address regions:
    0x00‚Äì0x3F ‚Üí Slave0
    0x40‚Äì0x7F ‚Üí Slave1

3Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Slave (Responding to Its Own Address Range) : Each slave stores data in its own internal memory and has random backpressure (delays before ready).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Interconnect (Bus Arbiter / Decoder) : This module connects one manager to two slaves, performing address decoding.

üß† What‚Äôs New Here :

| Concept                   | What It Demonstrates                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Address Decoding**      | Manager sends all requests to interconnect, which routes them to correct slave |
| **Multiple Slaves**       | Shows how a bus can serve different address spaces                             |
| **Backpressure**          | Slave randomly delays its ready ‚Äî tests manager‚Äôs wait logic                   |
| **Response Multiplexing** | Interconnect chooses which slave‚Äôs data/resp go back                           |
| **Extensible Interface**  | The same `bus_if` structure reused for all paths                               |
