Let’s now enhance the simple manager–slave example with more realistic behavior — step by step.
🚀 Now the manager can send bursts, and waits for ready+response.
🚀 Now the slave: Adds random response delay (latency), Handles burst read/write & Generates response codes

⚙️ Goal: Next-Level Bus Transaction Model - We’ll enhance the earlier version with:
  Handshake protocol (valid + ready)
  Read/Write latency (delayed response)
  Burst transactions (multiple data beats per command)
  Response signal (resp) for OK/ERROR
  Clear separation of combinational vs sequential logic

🧠 What from This Version : 

| Feature                     | Why It Matters                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Handshake (valid+ready)** | Models real bus behavior like AXI, AHB, Wishbone |
| **Burst transfers**         | Adds multi-beat transaction realism              |
| **Latency/random delay**    | Emulates variable memory access times            |
| **Response field**          | Mimics error signaling (OKAY/SLVERR)             |
| **Structured interface**    | Makes it scalable to multiple agents             |
