Let’s now enhance the simple manager–slave example with more realistic behavior — step by step.
🚀 Now the manager can send bursts, and waits for ready+response.
🚀 Now the slave: Adds random response delay (latency), Handles burst read/write & Generates response codes

⚙️ Goal: Next-Level Bus Transaction Model - We’ll enhance the earlier version with:
  Handshake protocol (valid + ready)
  Read/Write latency (delayed response)
  Burst transactions (multiple data beats per command)
  Response signal (resp) for OK/ERROR
  Clear separation of combinational vs sequential logic
