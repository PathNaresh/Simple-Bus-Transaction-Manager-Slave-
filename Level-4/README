Level-4 SystemVerilog upgrade that :

Splits read and write channels (separate handshakes)
Adds transaction IDs (to track outstanding requests)
Adds monitors + scoreboard (class-based) to automatically check that reads return the values written earlier
Keeps the interconnect + multiple slaves from Level-3 with address decode and routing
Uses interface + virtual interface for clean connectivity

Key design choices / notes :

Uses SystemVerilog (interfaces, typedef struct, classes, mailbox).
Manager issues writes/reads with an id (4-bit here). Manager allows multiple outstanding transactions.
Monitors put transaction records into mailboxes for the scoreboard.
Scoreboard keeps a golden memory and checks read responses against previous writes.
Two slaves (address ranges 0x00..0x3F and 0x40..0x7F) with random latency and independent read/write behavior.
